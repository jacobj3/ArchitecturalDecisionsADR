# Architectural Decision Record: Payment Integration

**Status**

Accepted

**Context**

For the food ordering app to conduct safe and easy transactions, the team must incorporate a payment gateway.

**Decision**

For payment processing within the app, we have opted to use Stripe. We can set up subscriptions, accept payment cards, and use digital wallets thanks to Stripe, a reliable provider. It is renowned for being secure, simple to use for developers, and having an abundance of useful documentation.


**Consequences**

By utilizing Stripe, we can guarantee the dependability and security of payments performed through the app. Consumers may keep their data secure while making payments using a number of different approaches. We need to make sure Stripe is properly installed and tested in order to guarantee seamless payment processing. To maintain our app's compatibility with Stripe's service, we also need to keep an eye out for any updates from them.
