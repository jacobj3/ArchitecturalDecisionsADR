# Architectural Decision Record: Payment Integration

**Status**

Accepted

**Context**

For the food ordering app to conduct safe and easy transactions, the team must incorporate a payment gateway.

**Decision**

For payment processing within the app, we have opted to use Stripe. We can set up subscriptions, accept payment cards, and use digital wallets thanks to Stripe, a reliable provider. It is renowned for being secure, simple to use for developers, and having an abundance of useful documentation.


**Consequences**

We can ensure the security and dependability of payments made through the app by using Stripe. Customers can pay in a variety of methods while maintaining the security of their data. In order to ensure that payments processes are smooth, we must ensure that Stripe is configured correctly and thoroughly tested. We also need to monitor any updates from Stripe to keep our app working well with their service.
