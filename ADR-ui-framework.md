# Architectural Decision Record: UI Framework

**Status**

Accepted

**Context**

In order to build the native mobile application's user interface, the team must decide on a UI framework.

**Decision**

We have selected React Native as the UI framework for the food ordering app. With just one set of code, we can make it work on different platforms, which saves time and money for updates and building. It offers diverse approaches to design the app with a rich set of UI components and helps us develop quickly with instant updates.


**Consequences**

By using React Native we take advantage of native mobile app performance and the advantages of a familiar development environment for web developers. In contrast to completely native development, we might run into restrictions with regard to platform-specific functionality and UI customization.
